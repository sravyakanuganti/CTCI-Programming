 * To check if a string is permutation of the other string. For two strings to be permutation of each other,
 * they need to satisfy below conditions:
 * a) both the strings need to be of equal length.
 * b) all the characters in both the strings must be the same.
 * 
 * Brute force: 1)Generate each possible permutation for the first string and check if it is equal to the 
 * second string. 
 * Time: O(n!)
 * Space: O(n) to store each new permutation.
 * 
 * 2) For each character in the first string, count the number of occurrences of the character in both 
 * strings and compare. If they are equal, continue. Else return false.
 * Time: O(n^2) for each character, we need to traverse n characters of both strings
 * Space: O(1)
 * 
 * Sorting: Sort both strings (using char arrays and convert them back to string) and compare them. 
 * If they are equal, return true. Else, false.
 * Time: O(n log n) for sorting.
 * Space: O(1)
